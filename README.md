# SPN-LinearCryptanalysis
This repository has an implementation of a Substitution Permutation Network based Block Cipher and its Cryptanalysis. It features a random plaintext generator (16bit). The Encryption algorithm generates the ciphertext for the random Plaintexts generated. The Cryptanalysis Algorithm then uses the ciphertexts to find certain key bits of the key used in encryption.
The Substitution - Boxes and key are taken from the book 'Cryptography : Theory and Practice' by Douglas Stinson.
This repository is part of my Summer Project 2018.
